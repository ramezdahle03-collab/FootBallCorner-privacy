  <h1>Privacy Policy - Football Quiz App</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 12/09/2025</p>

  <p>Thank you for playing <strong>FootBallCorner</strong> ("the App," "we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our primary goal is to provide you with an engaging and smooth gaming experience. The information we handle can be categorized as follows:</p>

  <h3>a) Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h3>
  <p>To save your game progress, settings, and high scores, we use <code>shared_preferences</code>. This data is stored exclusively on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.</p>

  <h3>b) Data Collected by Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>We integrate third-party services into our App to provide core functionalities like advertisements and in-app purchases. These services may collect information about you.</p>

  <p><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Our app uses Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob is an advertising service provided by Google Inc. It may collect data such as your device ID, IP address, and advertising identifiers to provide personalized ads. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob. We strongly encourage you to review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Google Play In-App Purchases:</strong> When you make a purchase within the App (e.g., to buy items or remove ads), the transaction is processed securely by the Google Play Store. We do not collect, receive, or store any sensitive payment information, such as your credit card number. We only receive a confirmation token from Google that a purchase has been completed.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain Our Service:</strong> Ensuring the app functions correctly and saving your progress.</li>
    <li><strong>To Provide Advertisements:</strong> Displaying relevant ads to support the free version of our App.</li>
    <li><strong>To Process Transactions:</strong> Facilitating in-app purchases through the Google Play Store.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. Our App does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:ramezdahle03@gmail.com">ramezdahle03@gmail.com</a>. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our records.</p>

  <h2>4. Security</h2>
  <p>We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your information. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
